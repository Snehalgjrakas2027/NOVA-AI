Barish, the gentle rain's refrain
Brings life to parched earth, and soothes the brain
The droplets fall, like tears of love
Cooling the skin, sent from above

The world outside, transforms with ease
From dull to bright, in gentle breeze
The trees regain their vibrant hue
As petals dance, in rhythm anew

The scent of wet earth fills the air
As petrichor awakens, without a care
The sound of raindrops, a symphony sweet
Echoes through, the city's busy beat

Barish, a moment's peace, we adore
A chance to unwind, and ask for more
A time to reflect, and let the soul breathe
As the rain washes away, our deepest grief

So let the raindrops, continue to fall
And bring us closer, to nature's wall
For in this barish, we find our peace
A sense of calm, that our hearts can't release.
