Here's a romantic shayari:

"Tere bina zindagi se koi shikwa nahin,
Koi dard nahin, koi gum nahin,
Tere bina main to kabhi nahin khila,
Kabhi nahin khila, kabhi nahin bhi khila.

Tere bina main to kabhi nahin soya,
Kabhi nahin soya, kabhi nahin bhola,
Tere bina main to kabhi nahin chala,
Kabhi nahin chala, kabhi nahin bhala.

Tere bina zindagi se koi shikwa nahin,
Koi dard nahin, koi gum nahin,
Tere bina main to kabhi nahin khila,
Kabhi nahin khila, kabhi nahin bhi khila."

Translation:

"There is no complaint, no pain, no sorrow,
Without you, my life is not worth living,
I never laughed, never slept, never woke,
Without you, my life is not worth living.

Without you, I never slept, never woke up,
Never found peace, never felt calm,
Without you, I never walked, never moved,
Never felt peaceful, never felt calm.

There is no complaint, no pain, no sorrow,
Without you, my life is not worth living,
I never laughed, never slept, never woke,
Without you, my life is not worth living."
