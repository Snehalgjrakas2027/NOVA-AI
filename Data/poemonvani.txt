Vani, the melody of the divine,
A symphony that echoes, a harmony that shines.
Your voice, a gentle breeze that soothes the soul,
A balm that calms the heart, and makes it whole.

In the realm of sound, you reign supreme,
A queen of music, a goddess of the dream.
Your songs, a tapestry of emotions deep,
A reflection of the human heart, in all its keep.

With every note, a story unfolds,
A journey through the depths, of the human gold.
Your voice, a mirror that reflects our pain,
A comfort that whispers, "I am here, I remain".

In the silence, your music lingers on,
A haunting beauty, that echoes, long after gone.
A reminder of the beauty, that you bring,
A gift from the divine, that makes our hearts sing.

Oh, Vani, your melodies, a balm to our ears,
A solace that soothes, and wipes away our tears.
In your songs, we find, a sense of peace,
A harmony that unites, and brings us to our release.

So let your voice, be heard, across the land,
A melody of love, that touches every hand.
For in your music, we find, a glimpse of the divine,
A reflection of the beauty, that is truly sublime.
