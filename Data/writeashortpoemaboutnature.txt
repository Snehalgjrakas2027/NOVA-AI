Here's a short poem about nature:

"Nature's Symphony"

The sun rises high and bright,
A new day dawns, with morning light.
The birds sing sweet, their melodies so fine,
A chorus of life, in harmony divine.

The trees sway gently, in the breeze so light,
Their leaves rustling, with a soothing might.
The flowers bloom, with colors so bold,
A canvas of beauty, to behold.

The river flows, with a gentle stream,
Reflecting the beauty, of nature's dream.
The mountains rise, with a majestic height,
A testament to, nature's incredible might.

In nature's arms, we find our peace,
A sense of calm, that our souls release.
Let us cherish, this world so grand,
And preserve its beauty, in this nature land.
