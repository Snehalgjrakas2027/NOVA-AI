Here's a poem on engineering:

In steel and stone, a dream takes shape
A masterpiece born, of human fate
The engineer's art, a symphony plays
A dance of wires, a rhythm of ways

With codes and circuits, they weave a spell
A magic that's real, and all can tell
The hum of machinery, a song so sweet
A symphony of progress, at our feet

From bridges high, to circuits low
The engineer's touch, makes innovation grow
A fusion of art, and science so fine
A marriage of wonder, a work divine

In every field, their mark is made
From buildings tall, to robots displayed
Their passion and skill, a story untold
A legacy of progress, forever to hold

With every step, a new path is cleared
A journey to the future, with no fear
For the engineer, no challenge is too great
Their imagination, a boundless state

So here's to the engineers, of today and tomorrow
Their work a testament, to human power
May their creations, forever stand tall
A monument to innovation, for one and all.
